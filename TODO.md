                I can turn this on and off but when I turn it off the rotation resets
                which is not what we want ... we will have to see what immersive mode means
            - [x] use (unbounded mode)[https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.polyspatial.visionos@2.3/manual/FAQ.html#q-objects-that-are-supposed-to-face-the-camera-transformlookat-are-not-working]
                - [x] initial spike
                - [x] fix tracking hand instead of head ... wtf
                    - had to add an XR Origin and use the Main Camera as a tracking target
                    - probably simply could have used any object with a `TrackedPoseDriver (Input System)` component on it (with the right configuration), but did not test this
                    - note I had to reset the `Camera Offset`'s position as well as the `Camera Y Offset` on the `XR Origin` to zero, otherwise there was an offset in what was tracked
                - [x] fix turn around of billboard!?
                    - turns out Quads are just facing away from the user with their front UV .. fixed via rotation

            - [x] fix minimum/maximum (?) size (see what Vision OS Windows do)
                - just fixing minimum for now
            - [x] lock control when selected
            - [x] disable non-active controls
            - [x] scale Z movement based on distance from avatar for fast movement further away
            - [x] test and optimize on vision pro

    - [x] allow loading texture from URL
    - [x] set image ratio automatically
    - [x] add loading and error placeholders / animations

## Backlog

### OPTIONAL: Window control optimizations
- [ ] fix movement distortions when starting very far to the left 
    ... need to scale movement distance based on distance from hand
- [ ] maybe also improve resizing feeling?
- [ ] make control size change similar to Vision OS (there seems to be some scaling)
    - mhm, this is kind of difficult because they scale the frame funnily
- [ ] fix initial control size
- [ ] sometimes there is an overlap so resize controls seem to be scaled wrong

### OPTIONAL: Image loading
- [ ] OPTIONAL: smoothly animated transitions between loading, error, and main image
- [ ] OPTIONAL: animate resizing when image is loaded

### Interactive

- [ ] Pan / Zooming (this is a bit tricky because I don't know how controls should work)


### Image content

- [ ] Allow border overlay in some shaders (so image can shine through border)

### Fancy stuff

I'll add those when I need them.

- [ ] Shadows
    - [ ] Try simple inverse lerp / smoothstep shadow (no conditions)
    - [ ] Enable some inner and outer shadows
    - [ ] can this be more efficient if we use same border radius? (see optimization)

- [ ] Bloom / glow for neon effect?
- [ ] Border gradients
- [ ] Dashed border
- [ ] Support text somehow?
- [ ] Support some icons?

### Interaction

- [ ] experiment with different interaction framework
    - [ ] move as default not with extra control?

### Optimization

- [ ] Test whether reusing shader based controls between images is more efficient
- [ ] For stacked border test whether chaining makes a difference
- [ ] Can we optimize the Rounded Rectangle Fraction ... I think it is too inefficient
    - [x] optimize by moving code out of shader ... helps a lot
    - [ ] maybe try something with equal corner radius?
    - [ ] another thing could be to try to get rid of the subtraction for corners ... mh
    - mhm, think about different border widths, too, though
- [ ] generally, can we make borders without subtraction? ... probably not actually
- [ ] I think, with the optimizations below we can make shadow fractions easily
- [ ] for corners, I could use the same approach as the built in rounded rectangle uses!
    - [x] can we use this for shadow corners as well? YES THAT WORKS!!! NICE!!! :D
- [ ] for full frames maybe use simple rounded rectangle for further optimization
- [ ] for shadows can we build more efficient shadows if we use equal corner radii?
    - see simple rounded rectangle (generated shader code)
- [ ] check if [MaterialPropertyBlock](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MaterialPropertyBlock.html) does anything to help us
- [ ] optimize rounded corner shadow (variables inside custom nodes can be reused)
- [ ] run benchmarks on Meta Quest
- [ ] benchmark shaders
    - [x] implement benchmarks
    - [x] run on vision pro
        - there is nearly NO difference ... WTF ... we will see in practice
    - [ ] OPTIONAL: run on Meta Quest?
        - [ ] make shaders look nice on meta quest
    - [ ] deprecate/archive where no performance difference is observed
    - [ ] update shader gallery and move deprecated ones to extra galleries
