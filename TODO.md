# TODO

## Animation / controls

- [ ] Allow rounded corners for pill and make vertical pill (efficiency difference?)
- [ ] Make fraction of rounded rectangle in a single shader graph
- [ ] Create script to find corner fraction points based on scale, border width, corner radius, etc.

## Image content

- [ ] Account for texture size when scaling
- [ ] Test many borders with images ... oh oh!!
- [ ] Allow border overlay in some shaders (so image can shine through border)

## Shadows

- [ ] Try simple inverse lerp / smoothstep shadow (no conditions)
- [ ] Enable some inner and outer shadows

## Fancy stuff

- [ ] Bloom / glow for neon effect?
- [ ] Border gradients
- [ ] Dashed border
- [ ] Support text somehow?
- [ ] Support some icons?

## Optimization

- [ ] For stacked border test whether chaining makes a difference

## Interactive

- [ ] Pan / Zooming
- [ ] Resize
- [ ] Crop and copy
- [ ] Hover animation
