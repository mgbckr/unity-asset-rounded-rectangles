## Next

### Animation / controls

- [x] Make vertical pill (efficiency difference?)
- [x] Make fraction of rounded rectangle fraction in a single shader graph
- [ ] Add rounded corners to rounded rectangle fraction
- [ ] Create script to find corner fraction points based on scale, border width, corner radius, etc.

### Image with content

- [ ] Make simple, single border image
- [ ] Load images from URL?
- [ ] Make three or four windows
- [ ] Account for texture size when scaling
- [ ] Test many borders with images ... oh oh!!

### Interactive

- [ ] Add dummy controls
- [ ] Move / Close
- [ ] Resize
    - [ ] Make controls usable
    - [ ] Animate controls
- [ ] Pan / Zooming

## Backlog

### Interactive

- [ ] Crop and copy
- [ ] Hover animation

### Image content

- [ ] Allow border overlay in some shaders (so image can shine through border)

### Fancy stuff

I'll add those when I need them.

- [ ] Shadows
    - [ ] Try simple inverse lerp / smoothstep shadow (no conditions)
    - [ ] Enable some inner and outer shadows

- [ ] Bloom / glow for neon effect?
- [ ] Border gradients
- [ ] Dashed border
- [ ] Support text somehow?
- [ ] Support some icons?

### Optimization

- [ ] For stacked border test whether chaining makes a difference
